                        <p>Join us, as we explore the secrets of cheap t-shirts.</p>
                        <h3>Democracy through T-Shirts?</h3>
                        <p>A night blue Porsche Carrera rolls through a small town west of Berlin. It stops at a parking lot just short of a sign inscribed with the name “Sahm.” A gaunt man steps out, walks into a small enterprise and lights a cigarette. His name is Horst Sahm and he heads the enterprise. He is here to talk about a T-Shirt.</p>
                        <p>In the next hour, Sahm only takes a break from his cigarettes to sip coffee. He doesn’t appear to be someone who believes in a healthy lifestyle, but rather good clothing. He sports brown leather shoes and a beige suit. When he stands the suit doesn’t slip out of place; it doesn’t wrinkle. For Horst Sahm, solid seams and a good cut are no small matter. He has worked in the fashion industry for half his life – in Germany, Hong Kong, and throughout the rest of the world. </p>
                        <p>The T-shirt sits in front of him on the table. The collar is embossed with the letter H and the letter M.</p>
                        <p>These two letters signal a global empire. This empire spans 38 countries, 2078 stores, and employees 76 000 people momentarily. Swedish clothing company Hennes & Mauritz, H&M, is also constantly opening up new branches. </p>
                        <img className="image-center-lg" src="/images/cotton.jpg" alt="cotton"/>
                        <p>If you had to describe H&M in a single sentence, you’d say something along the lines of “looks good, costs next to nothing.” A jacket costs €30 – a pair of jeans €20. The cheapest item is the T-shirt. </p>
                        <p>It’s white, simple and is rounded at the collar. Before the single European currency arrived, you could buy a T-shirt like this for 9.90 German marks. Since then, a lot has changed in Germany. Electricity, bread, currywurst, nearly everything got more expensive. But not the H&M T-Shirt. It costs €4.95. It’s hard to pay less for a T-shirt. </p>
                        <p>H&M issues a sustainability report annually. It is 85 pages thick. It describes how H&M advocates against child labour, exploitation and environmental destruction. We belong to the good companies. That’s the message contained in the report.  </p>
                        <h3>The H&M Principle: The Same T-Shirt for All</h3>
                        <p>How can a company be good and, at the same time, sell T-Shirts that are so cheap?</p>
                        <p>H&M has the answer to this question. Its headquarters, located in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, include a ground floor stocked with the same clothes that one could buy in Berlin, Tokyo, or San Francisco. The same T-shirt for the whole word – that’s the H&M principle.</p>
                        <p>On the first floor, the offices begin to appear. Here you can meet with the head designer or an employee working in corporate sustainability. But no one says how or where the ubiquitous T-shirt is manufactured – let alone who makes it. H&M doesn’t disclose such information – for competitive reasons.</p>
                        <p>So we have to take matters into our own hands. If H&M won’t show us the way, we’ll need a pathfinder – someone who understands operations of companies like H&M, someone with knowledge on cotton, minimum wages as well as freight and shipping rates from Asia. Someone like Horst Sahm.</p>
                        <p>Sahm picks up the T-shirt. He is in his mid-fifties and one year ago he started his own consulting business. Most of his clients are textile firms. Currently he is often on business in Tunisia; his mandate is to supply the garment factories with more work. </p>
                        <p>With his cigarette in his mouth, he runs his fingers over the material and inspects the label. He explains that if you want to know the secret of the cheap T-Shirt you first have to travel far west. That is where the trail begins. </p>
                        <p>It’s early in the morning when Dean Vardeman leaves his home. He walks past his brother’s home, his parents’, past two barns as big as factories, part tractors and ploughs; he walks across the farm – as big as a Bavarian peasant village.</p>

                        <p>He stands in the field – a 60-year old man, short and stocky – between two beaten bushes. He wears a baseball cap with a white star on a blue background with one red and white strip to its side. It’s the Texas State flag.</p>

                        <p>Vardeman pulls a short knife from his pocket. He plucks a capsule from a twig and cuts into it to test its resistance. He nods with satisfaction. It’s the end of September. A few more weeks until the capsules burst open and cotton swells out. Soft and thick, it will hang from the bushes, like warm snow.</p> 

                        <p>They will harvest cotton for 12 hours a day. Dean Vardeman, his younger brother, and his 82-year old father will steer the harvesters, the size of combines. They’ll listen to the radio, FM 96.3, Lubbocks best country music.</p>

                        <p>Lubbock is a farming town in North Texas. 225 000 people live here and most of them work with cotton. They plant it, research it in the lab, and export it. Cotton fields stretch all the way to the airport.</p> 

                        <p>Dean Vardeman is not only a farmer, he is also an inventor. On his shelf sits a golden plaque mounted on wood. It reads “US Patent 6018938” and “High Capacity Cotton Harvester” just below.</p> 

                        <p>This machine is parked in the yard. It is a John Deere 7460 Cotton Stripper. Vardeman developed the mechanism that allows the cotton stripper to harvest eight rows of cotton shrubs simultaneously. In one day, he is able to harvest as much cotton as 300 workers; more than any other previous machine.</p> 
                        <img className="image-center-lg" src="/images/cotton-truck.jpg" alt="tractor"/>
                        <p>Back in his office west of Berlin, textile expert, Horst Sahm, had said that 400 grams of cotton were needed for the H&M T-Shirt. Last year, it would have cost 40 cents for that amount. The T-Shirt is cheap because the raw material was so inexpensive.</p> 

                        <p>If a raw material is cheap it’s because too much of it exists. Someone produced more than the world needed. With cotton it was the Americans and their modern harvesters.</p> 

                        <p>The John Deere Cotton Stripper leads to cheap T-Shirts. At least that seems to be the first secret behind to the €4.95 T-Shirt.</p> 

                        <p>It’s a nice secret and it fits well with H&M’s sustainability report. Thanks to the inventiveness of an American farmer, no one must partake in the backbreaking labour to harvest cotton like the African slaves once did. The T-Shirt can be sold for next to nothing. It could be this way. </p> 

                        <p>It could be like this if it weren’t for another number. US $405,089.</p> 

                        <p>This is how much the American government has transferred to the Vardeman family over the last ten years.</p> 
                        <img className="image-center-lg" src="/images/sewing.jpg" alt="sewing"/>

                        <p>A threat lives in India, West Africa – in poor countries like Mali or Burkina Faso. In those countries, there are farmers that produce cotton for half the price of the Americans. Farmers without a John Deere Cotton Stripper. They have their hands, nothing more, and yet still they outmatch farmers with even the most efficient machines. Because all they need to survive is a few bowls of rice each day. </p> 

                        <p>In America, there are 19,000 cotton farmers. In the past ten years, they received US $25 billion for the government. Tempted by this money, they planted enough cotton for ten billion T-Shirts each year. Cotton became cheaper. The T-Shirt too. Not only did American tax payers subsidize their farmers; they also subsidized the H&M T-Shirt.</p> 

                        <p>In India and Africa there are 10,000,000 cotton farmers. They don’t receive money from the government, but rather from the global market. The low cotton price of recent years made it nearly impossible to live.</p> 

                        <p>In West Africa, tens of thousands of desperate farmers left their fields and headed into the slums. In India, thousands of farmers swallowed the liquid poison that they originally bought to spray their fields. The chemicals were supposed to kill worms. It killed humans too; they just had to drink enough of it.</p> 
                        <img className="image-center-lg" src="/images/t-shirt.jpg" alt="t-shirt"/>

                        <p>Dean Vardeman holds the T-Shirt in his hand. In his barn, you’ll find two motorboats and his father’s camper, which is as big as two cotton strippers. It’s difficult to blame him for receiving public money. Nearly all governments in the world support their farmers if they can afford to do so. Even India has started to do so; there were simply too many suicides. Dean Vardeman simply has the good fortune to live in a rich nation; that’s all.</p> 

                        <p>Vardeman inspects the T-Shirt. Whether summer or winter, the white T-Shirt appears in every H&M collection. Nonetheless it changes. The collar is bit narrower than compared to the previous year; the T-shirt feels lighter because of it; fashion demands it. Vardeman doesn’t notice the collar or note the H&M logo. It’s as if he wasn’t holding a T-shirt at all, but still the raw material, the fruit of his labour. Pride is in eyes. For more than 100 years, his family has farmed cotton. “Isn’t cotton wonderfully soft?” he says.</p> 

                        <p>His mobile phone rings. “Hi Bob,” he says. Bob is a retiree from South Texas. He used to live in Lubbock. He’s rented the fields to Vardeman. For this, Bob receives one quarter of the earnings. He is calling because he wants to know how much money he can expect.</p> 

                        <p>Of late financial investors all over the globe are buying cotton</p>

                        <p>“Look at the curve, Bob,” says Vardeman, “it’s fantastic.” </p>

                        <p>The curve is blue. You can look it up on the Internet. It runs upwards steeply like the curve of a successful stock. The curve describes the evolution of the cotton price. </p>

                        <p>Unusual events happened over the past few months. The weather was bad in China’s cotton growing regions. In Pakistan, floods destroyed the cotton. All over the world, investors started to buy cotton because stocks weren’t worth it. </p>

                        <p>There isn’t too much cotton in the world anymore. There is too little. The price increased and appears to be continuing to increase. The Vardemans will receive a lot of money for their crop. They’ll hardly need subsidies.</p> 

                        <p>The 400 grams of cotton needed for the T-shirt doesn’t cost 40 cents, but now nearly €1.00. The raw material has become expensive. The search for the cheap T-shirt changes direction.
